# My Awesome Note Taker
  ![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)
 
  ## Description
  The motivation for building this project was to create an application that can store notes for an individual. This solves orginizational issues and is a helper to visually see what notes you have. During this project I applied what I learned in class and I also attempted to use the delete request, and even though I think it looks right, it isn't working so I will have to get with an instructor or my tutor to figure out what is missing or incorrect.
